This project was made open source on 11 November 2014.

This version of tripl.it uses meteor. The reason for that is the out of the box offline database, synchronization and conflict resolution.

# Install

You need to install meteor first

```
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Running the application should be enough now

```
$ meteor
```
